# cloudcrowd is an app for the dreamers in life always looking at the sky above. In the current landscape there is nothing on mobile to help users document, identify and record clouds. Cloudcrowd does just that letting users learn about clouds by reviewing cards with information and interesting facts. It allows users to photograph, compare and identify cloud formations.
Cloudcrowd is a swift application using CoreData for local persistance. With time this app will grow into a tight-knit social platform. Future versions will support the ability for artificial intelligence to aid in the identification of clouds as well.
